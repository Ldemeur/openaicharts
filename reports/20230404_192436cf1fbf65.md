# Summary
The analysis of the food-enforcement dataset provided insights into several aspects of food recalls.

1. **Recalls by State**: California (CA) had the highest number of food recalls, followed by Texas (TX), Illinois (IL), New York (NY), and Michigan (MI).
2. **Recall Classifications**: About 51.1% of recalls were "Class II," 43.3% were "Class I," and 5.6% were "Class III."
3. **Days between the recall initiation and termination**: The average number of days between the recall initiation date and the termination date was approximately 378 days.
4. **Top Reasons for Recalls**: The most common reasons for recalls were:
  * Product may contain undeclared milk (618 recalls)
  * Products not manufactured under GMP's (353 recalls)
  * Products were not held at an appropriate temperature due to a mechanical malfunction during transportation (330 recalls)
  * Five patients who were treated in a single hospital in Kansas were infected with one of four rare strains of Listeria monocytogenes (286 recalls)
  * Product may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes (281 recalls)
5. **Voluntary vs. Mandated Recalls**: Most recalls were voluntary and initiated by the firm (22,135), while only 397 were FDA mandated. There were 6 recalls with missing information and 929 labeled as "Voluntary: Firm Initiated."
6. **Most Common Notification Method**: The most common initial firm notification method was a combination of two or more of the following: Email, Fax, Letter, Press Release, Telephone, Visit (with 8,917 occurrences).

Overall, these findings provide valuable insights into food recalls, their causes, and the methods used for notification. This analysis can help in understanding the critical areas of focus within the food industry regarding safety and mitigation strategies.
